## Hi there 👋

I'm Morgane 🇫🇷. I'm currently learning how to be a dev, long-term I wish to be able to work with people from all over the world, but for now I'm learning different languages, frameworks, etc. 

My hobbies include but are not limited to :
- 🎮 video games : minecraft, pathfinder, plate up and the list goes on
- 🎲 board games : so many, from casual to expert to a 14hr session of Twilight Imperium, I'm actually a member of a local board game association
- 🐉 roleplay : dungeon and dragons is wonderful, I'm a beginner, and finding tables is a bit hard though
- 🐘 animals : I have a cute little demon 🐕 also called Pixel, I'm a big fan of turtles 🐢, if I see an animal I'm happy
- 🗺️ holidays : I went to Croatia, Canada (lived there 2 years), USA, Balearic Islands. My dream is to go to New Zealand
- 🎢 theme parks : Disneyland Paris, La Ronde (Montréal), EuropaPark, Port Aventura

Feel free to contact me to talk about anything, be it work, France, or to talk about hobbies we might have in common 🙂
